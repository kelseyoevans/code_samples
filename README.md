# code_samples
This repository contains code samples for Kelsey Evans. 
Any .csv files needed to run the .Rmd files are also provided. The scripts pull the .csv's in from the working directory. 
The .csv file "billboardHot100_1999-2019.csv" is too large for github, but can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019 (available for public use).
