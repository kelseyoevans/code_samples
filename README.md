This repository contains code samples for Kelsey Evans. 

"Thesis" is my thesis for the major in Statistics & Data Science. (needs: Hot Stuff, hook, total, and artistDf)

Any .csv files needed to run the .Rmd files are also provided. The scripts pull the .csv's in from the working directory. 

The .csv file "billboardHot100_1999-2019.csv" , also needed, is too large for github, but can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019 (available for public use). 

"World Bank Data" is a multivariate analysis using publicly available World Bank data. (needs: WB5)

"Michigan Dialect" is a project where I wrote a survey taken by ~500 participants and analyzed the data.
